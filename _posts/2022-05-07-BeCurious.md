[Be Curious](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/becurious) is an event run by the University of Leeds aiming to show the public some of the research happening at the University. We presented our work at Be Curious under the name "What can computers learn from your voice?". At the event we showed families how computers can be used to learn things about your voice. We created an app which could predict a person's age based on their voice. We also challenged people to beat the computer in guessing the age and gender of a person based only on their voice.
