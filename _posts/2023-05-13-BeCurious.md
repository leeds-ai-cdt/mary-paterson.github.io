title: Be Curious 2023
---

We had so much fun at [Be Curious](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/becurious) last year that we went again this year! We showed about 300 people (mainly families with primary school aged children) just how amazing machine learning can be. We challenged our system to guess how old people were from how their voice sounded and put families to the test seeing if they could beat the computer in guessing the age and gender of people based only on their voice. We love being able to share our work with so many people and inspiring the next generation of scientists and researchers.
